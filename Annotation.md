# Annotation

When it comes to a supervised learning problem, or simply evaluating your model, data is much more useful if it has annotations or labels.

There are many tools that can be used to annotate or label data. Oxen is agnostic to what tools you use for annotation, but can track the changes to your data over time so that it is easy to audit or restore an older version.

Some popular annotation tools include

* [Label Studio](https://labelstud.io/) Label Studio is a configurable data annotation tool that works with different data types
* [Make Sense](https://github.com/SkalskiP/make-sense) Modern tool for labeling images

# Writing Documentation

[All Documentation](https://docs.oxen.ai)

To build and view the documentation locally, run the following from the "oxen/docs" directory: 

```bash
$ make html
```

Then open `oxen/docs/build/html/index.html` in your browser.

To contribute to the docs, make any changes in the `oxen/docs/source` directory, build using the instructions above, and `commit` and `push` the new `source` and `build` directories.

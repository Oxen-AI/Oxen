# Command Line Interface

The Oxen command line interface is inspired by [git](https://git-scm.com/doc), which makes it easy to learn if you 
are already familiar with common software engineering practices.

## Initialization

Navigate to the directory where your data lives

```
cd /path/to/my/dataset
```

If the repository is not already initialized, you can use the `init` command

```
oxen init
```

## Status

```
oxen status
```

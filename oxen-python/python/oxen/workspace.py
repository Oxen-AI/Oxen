class Workspace:
    """
    The Workspace class allows you to interact with an Oxen workspace
    without downloading the data locally.

    Workspaces can be created off a branch and is tied to the commit id of the branch
    at the time of creation.

    You can commit a Workspace back to the same branch if the branch has not
    advanced, otherwise you will have to commit to a new branch and merge.

    ## Examples

    ### Adding Files to a Workspace

    Create a workspace from a branch.

    ```python
    from oxen import RemoteRepo
    from oxen import Workspace

    # Connect to the remote repo
    repo = RemoteRepo("ox/CatDogBBox")

    # Create the workspace
    workspace = Workspace(repo, "my-branch")

    # Add a file to the workspace
    workspace.add("my-image.png")

    # Print the status of the workspace
    status = workspace.status()
    print(status.added_files())

    # Commit the workspace
    workspace.commit("Adding my image to the workspace.")
    ```

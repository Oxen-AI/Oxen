# Refactor Steps

1) Migration to compute latest commit and sizes for every node in the tree
2) Add a version compatibility check in repositories (since migrations take a while to run)
3) Update APIs to use old version if migration has not been run
4) Update `oxen add` and `oxen commit` to create the new merkle tree format
5) Kill post commit actions - just have one final POST commit to server that we can hook into

# Simple Cli App

This is a simple app to get started with `aruba`.

It comes with an executable, [`aruba-test-cli`](https://github.com/cli-testing/aruba-getting-started/blob/master/exe/aruba-test-cli), which is the application under test in the _Your First Tests with "aruba"_ tutorial steps in the [aruba documentation](https://app.cucumber.pro/projects/aruba#your-first-tests-with-aruba).

# Intent Classification in Natural Language Processing

Reading, writing, and speaking are the main ways we as humans interact with knowledge. It would be great if we could talk to computers as we talk to one another. 

The idea of AI Chat Bots as assistants has been around since the early days of computing. It is not an easy task to create a program that knows enough about the world and human language to be useful.

The problem is computer programs usually take human language too literal. Programs treat text as lists of characters and have no context into what it actually means. This has changed recently with the advent of neural networks called "transformers".

Transformers trained on internet scale datasets can now understand language better than ever. They use a complex linear algebra to compute the meaning of words given a context.

Luckily for you software libraries abstract a lot of this complex math away. Wouldn't it be great if you could specify "intents" in natural language and the computer would do what you ask?

This is where machine learning comes in. It is now easier than ever to feed in a list of examples to a computer and have it learn what you want it to do.

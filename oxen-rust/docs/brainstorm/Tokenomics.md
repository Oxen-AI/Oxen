# How Oxen could play in the crypto world

- Encrypt dataset with my keys
- Show file names and column names, no data
- Decrypt with smart contract to train on the data, no human ever sees
    - This could be problematic because you could send a model in to "OverFit" to the data and just extract it
    - We could probably detect this...? Test != Train && Model != memorize train
- How do we store/compute? FileCoin? ARWeave? Our own?
